# Lab Node Create an Application

If you have issues with this mab you can engage with the project's developer community through the repository GitHub Issues list, or contribute fixes and enhancements of your own via a Pull Request.
### Requirements

You'll need an Auth0 account. If you do not already have one, you can create a free one [here](https://auth0.com/signup).

This lab assumes the user is using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### What is Auth0?
---

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional [username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db).
* Add support for [linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/link-accounts) with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current).
